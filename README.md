# University of Richmond Coding Bootcamp - Prework Study guide README

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
    - My motivation for this project is to familiarize myself with Github, GitBash, VSCode, and their interactions.
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
    - I built this project to practice version control of coding projects. It gave an introduction to HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript.
- What problem does it solve?
    - It helps me get hands-on experience with the industry standard applications and programs.
- What did you learn?
    - Probably the most important thing I learned is that Github is a very effecient and powerful tool for tracking changes made to code - and they can be done from anywhere (after being set up properly).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
